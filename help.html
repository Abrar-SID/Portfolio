                <p>Welcome to my Year 11 Portfolio! This website showcases all the projects, assignments, 
                    and experiences I've completed during my time at Mount Albert Grammar School. If you 
                    need assistance navigating the site or understanding the content, here's a quick guide:
                </p>
                <h4>Navigation</h4>
                <p>
                    For navigation, the navigation bar is always on the top. In the home page, it is under the name.<br>
                    In the lessons page, there is a navigation column beside the Units, pressing on the names in the 
                    navigation bar will scroll you to that specific section. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    There's a neet trick. Try pressing the name above in the navigation bar?
                </p>
                <h4>Pages</h4>
                <p>
                    The Home page is the cover page. By going to the About page, you can get the description and purpose
                    of the website. <br>
                    The lessons page contains all the information of all the units and lessons completed within the Year 11 
                    session in 2024. <br>
                    If anymore help is required, feel free to come here and get the HELP required. Good Luck.
