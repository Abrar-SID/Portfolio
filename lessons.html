                            Mockups are high fidelity representations of websites, showing detailed elements
                            like layout, color schemes, typography, and interactive features.
                            I learnt how to make mockups in Term 2 of my Year 11 in MAGS. Mr.Robins started 
                            teaching it to us by first making hand-drawn mockups.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After that, we used the software "Figma" to make high-feidility digital mockups in
                            our laptops. We learnt the Nielsen's 10 Usability  heuristics and their applications in websites.
                            Keeping those in minds, we created I along my classmates created our own Mockups.

                            Unfortunately, this topic was discussed in Term 1 when I still hadn't joined MAGS. That's why
                            I couldn't learn Python coding during class. However, for the 1st week of my joining, Mr.Robins
                            introduced me to a coding website "Code Avengers" where I could learn the basics of python in just
                            2 special courses for free.

                            I couldn't finish it because our next unit had already started, but I learnt alot of things from there. I was even able to 
                            make a game where a turtle moves to draw shapes and also programmed so that i can intereact with the programm and it asks me
                            about my health.

                    <p>
                        html is a coding laguage that is used to make website structures. We were taught the basic of html and the tags that are present
                        and their functions. We learnt the importance of indentations in codes and how to make it easier to navigate through our codes
                        as well as the conventions of folders for coding html and css. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This is the first practise test that we did where we were told to make a nvaigation bar using the tags we had already learnt.
                        The focus was whether we could make a nvigation bar with menu buttons that are in a row and there is a slight gap between the
                        side of the web and the first nvaigation button.

                        html and css together are very essential when making a website. html gives the website structure and determines what will
                        be in it while css makes the website more appeasing providing the ability to customize the structure and easy to navigate.

                        After learning html and css, we used them together to start making websites. After learning how to make a navigation bar, we were
                        given some tests to find whether we can make copies of the website given. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This was one of those tests. Here we were tested to find whether we can put the hero image ourselves and also make the navigation 
                        bar in the middle. But our first website with hero image was this one. Here we learnt how to give hover effect and efficiently make
                        a navigation bar with a hero image under which also has a heading in it.

                        I am sure everyone is wondering how I made this website. Below is my Web Development Journal of this website that showcases all the 
                        steps I have taken to make this webite. This can also be used as a turtorial for beginners. You can download it if you want to use. <br>

                        This is not a Unit / Lesson taught or done in school. It's one of my hourable mentions and my most proudest personal works.
                        This is a picture story (comics of sorts) which I am currently making. It falls under the following genres: Action, Supernatural,
                        Horror, Military.
